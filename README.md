## Problem Statement:  

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes a Mobility Services firm has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Essentially the company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Business Goal:  

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
Based on the linear regression model that we trained, we can conclude that
1. As **Temperature** goes up the number of bike rentals go up
2. There is an increase in bike rentals over the year showing rising popularity of the company
3. People seem to be opting for bikes lesser when it is snowing and this has a huge impact to the bike rentals
4. Winter Season Before and After the snow seems to be a good time when bike rentals pick up


<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Recommendation
1. Services and other such operations for the bikes and stations can be kept in the off-season months especially spring time.
2. Winter and summer are the best times to push for more customers as customers are more likely to take a bike in these months
3. Temperature has a postive effect on Bike rentals and more marketing will be needed when the temperature drops
4. Marketing should be done to motivate people to use bikes in the start of the week as Mondays and Tuesdays has the most negative effect on the bike rentals
